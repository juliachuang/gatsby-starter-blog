Let's say you started your first job but the amount that you have depositing into your account is a lot lower than your hourly wages. The reason for this is that despite the fact that you are getting paid the federal minimum $7.25, a bunch of stuff is coming out of your paycheck. Knowing what is in your pay stub and how to read it will also make sure your employer is not missing any hours or anything and you can also get a better grasp of how much life costs.

ADP Pay Statement (ADP is one of the largest payroll processing service)

Below provides an explanation of the typical parts of a pay statement.

##1. Earnings

Earnings is the pretty straight-forward portion of your paycheck - when you get an offer letter or a job offer, your employer provides you with your gross hourly rate or salary.
Your earnings from an hourly rate is calculated by recording the number of hours you work multiplied by your hourly rate. Typically, hourly workers are often offered holiday pay or "time and a half" for any hours that exceed a standard 40 hours a week.
If you are a salaried worker, your salary is the amount you will receive from working a full year. This amount is calculated for the pay period by dividing how often you are paid by your salary. For a $50,000 salaried employee that gets paid bi-monthly (twice a month), that comes out to $2,083.33 a paycheck ($50,000 รท 24). For a $50,000 salaried employee that gets paid bi-weekly (every two weeks), that comes out to $1,923.08 ($50,000 รท 26).
If you receive any signing bonus or a bonus at the end of the year, that amount will also show in the Earnings section.
Additionally, any PTO (paid time off) or holidays you have taken may be reflected in this portion of a paycheck.

##2. Deductions - Taxes

The first thing that comes out of your paycheck are taxes and you will have to pay FICA taxes (which include Social Security and Medicare taxes) and Federal Income Tax (but this is only a withholding). When your federal income tax is filed at the end of year (actually, more likely April 15th the following year if you don't file an extension), you may get a bit of this money back in your tax refund. If your paycheck withholds too little, then you will owe the government some money.
If you happen to receive a bonus, then that amount is typically withheld at a higher rate than your normal salary at 25% (also known as the "percentage method") if you make less than $1 million. To a lower frequency, companies can also use the "aggregate method" of determining your withholding which involves summing your bonus and normal wage and using tax tables to determine the right withholding for the pay period.

##3. Deductions - Other

After taxes, other deductions may occur. These can include health insurance you automatically deduct from your paycheck, HSAs, FSAs, union dues, 401k contributions and anything you elect to have automatically removed from your paycheck.

##4. Net Pay

Finally, the net pay is what you see at the end after all taxes and deductions are pulled out. This is ultimately what gets direct deposited into your bank account or written out to you via check.

##5. Other Benefits

This is where you can see how much your company spends on you - additional benefits provided by your company are listed here!

##6. Pay Period

If you're an hourly worker, it's important to double check the pay period for which you're getting paid for. This will allow you to validate that you are being paid for the hours within the period range. For salaried workers, the frequency paid can help determine how much of your annual salary is being displayed.

##7. Withholding Rules

Your pay stub may also have a section that indicates what you filled out on your W-4. With this information, you can determine estimated tax withholdings. Having a higher exemption or allowance would indicate that less tax is being withheld from your paycheck because you would theoretically have the same exemptions on your tax return which would lower your taxable income.
