Before I jumped on the Vanguard bandwagon, I kept my Roth IRA funds over in, what was once, Capital One Sharebuilder. The only reason I moved over was because I refocused my retirement investment strategy to be minimal fee and effort – and the best option I saw for me was Vanguard with their plethora of index funds and ETFs (away from my earlier days of ill-chosen stock picks.)

When I did roll my funds over, though, my Vanguard account looked like the following. I was puzzled, why did my single Roth IRA account get divvied up into two accounts – one was a normal Roth IRA and one was a Roth IRA Brokerage?

##Why two accounts?

If you examine your two accounts, you’ll get one the “Roth IRA” where you can only buy/sell Vanguard funds. The second, the “Roth IRA Brokerage” is one where you can buy/sell Vanguard funds and purchase ETFs, stocks, securities, options, bonds or CDs. Basically, the “Roth IRA Brokerage” does a lot more than the normal account.

The reason for this confusion/ duplicate functionality is because Vanguard used to be a mutual fund only company. As Vanguard expanded to become The Vanguard Group, Vanguard came up with Vanguard Brokerage Services in addition to Vanguard Mutual Fund. Whenever you roll over an account with Vanguard mutual funds amongst other financial instruments,  your Vanguard mutual funds will go to the “Roth IRA” account whereas everything else goes to the “Roth IRA Brokerage” account.

##Consolidating into one account

Personally, I dislike having two accounts in the same that do essentially the same thing – so Vanguard made it easy to “upgrade” your plain Jane “Roth IRA” account to the “Roth IRA Brokerage”. This “upgrade” functionality basically moves all your “Roth IRA” holdings over to your “Roth IRA Brokerage” account. Just click on the “Upgrade” button under your “Roth IRA” account (and accept the changes that Vanguard discloses.)

While upgrading, the accounts will be denoted with an “In progress” note. However, afterward the “upgrade”, all your mutual funds will transition over to your Roth IRA Brokerage account.
