Unfortunately, we live in a society where we reward people who borrow money rather than pay for things within their means. (Of course, some of it is necessary - we wouldn't want have to save for 20 years for family to buy a home.) But in general, the credit card industry's easy credit ways often incentivizes a consumer to spend beyond their means. Unfortunately, this leads to credit card debt for people would could have avoided it in the first place.
Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express charge vendors a merchant fee anywhere from 1-4%. Due to pervasive use of credit card, most everything we purchase includes a mark up for the credit processing fees even if we're paying with cash (except for some select places that do differentiate price based on payment method). As a result, all we can do is play the credit game because at least we get a cut of the middle man's profits.
If you're wise enough to spend on a credit card how you would spend cash (as in pay it off every month), just go for using a credit card. There are many perks associated with credit cards if you can afford to not carry a balance.
So with that, let's move onto the topic of credit cards.
Types of Credit Cards
In general, there are four different types of rewards credit cards to look for and those can be:
 * Cash back
 * Travel-focused (hotels and airline)
 * Flexible points (Chase, Amex, Citi)
 * 0% APR

Cash back cards give you a certain percentage (typically 1-2%) of credit card purchases back to you. These could either be in dollar or point values which will eventually translate back to money redeemable via statement credit, direct deposit, check, or any other way your card issuer designates. They're usually pretty predictable, whatever you purchase, you automatically get a percentage back. This can vary for different categories, but for the reliable cashback card, you can look for one that gives a certain percentage regardless of whatever the purchase is categorized as.
Hotel and Airline cards give you points to whatever the card is branded for and tend to be used predominantly by people who have a preference towards a particular hotel chain or airline or are trying to accumulate points with certain hotel chains or airlines to score free travel.
Flexible points cards give you some sort of points that can be redeemable for a variety of other things. You can use the points similar to how you use a cash back card, transfer them for hotel and airline points, or use them on travel through the issuer's portal.
Finally, 0% APR cards allow you to carry a balance without worry of accumulating interest for a certain amount of time. Using 0% APR cards allows you to increase cash flow in the short term (by letting you not pay for anything immediately) but require a large payoff of the cards later on.
What card should you start off with?
Starter Credit Cards
Well, if you don't want to think too hard about anything and you have been keeping your expenses low, easy cash back cards the following are great starter cards without annual fees:
Citi Double Cash Back (2%) - 1% for the purchase, 1% when you pay it off
Chase Freedom Unlimited (1.5x points) - easy way to start accumulating Chase points in case you want to dive into Chase's reward program later
Chase Freedom/Discover IT - 5x rotating categories, otherwise 1x back on any others (Discover IT typically approves people with low credit scores
What to look for in a credit card?
One of the most important things I look at when applying for a card is fees associated, and in particular, the annual fee. You are charged an annual fee just for having a credit card even if you aren't spending on it. There are often perks with other cards that are worth paying the annual fee, but if you're getting introduced to credit cards, it's best to stay away.
Since I occasionally travel, I often also look for a card without a foreign transaction fee. This means when I pay for items abroad or am charged in a foreign currency (other than the US Dollar), I am not charged additional fees. Typically, card issues will charge around 3% for foreign transactions.
If you are planning on carrying a balance on your credit card, I would also look at the APR (annual percentage rate) to make sure you're not paying interest for as long as you can. However, if you don't think you can pay off your credit card every month, it's better to just not have a credit card.
